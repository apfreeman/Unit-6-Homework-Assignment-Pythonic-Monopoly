## Background

Harold's company has just started a new Real Estate Investment division to provide customers with a broader range of portfolio options. Harold was tasked with building a prototype dashboard, and he needs your help. The real estate team wants to trial this initial offering with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. If the new service is popular, then they can start to expand to other markets.

This dashboard has been created and provides charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

The dashboard contains the following tabs:

1. Welcome
  * This tab contains an interactive map of the Toronto area and neighbourhoods. You are able to zoom in and out and select neighbourhoods to see the average house price. The size of the dots on the map are representative of house prices small to large = least expensive to most.

2. Yearly Market Analysis
  * This tab contains a visual of each type of dwelling for the years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. You are able to interact with this graph including zoom, select, reset etc. This graph can help understand which dwelling types are increasing at the highest or lowest rate and therefore may determine demand. 

3. Shelter Costs vs House Value
* This tab shows the average costs for owned vs rented dwellings. This can help an investor understand the potential costs for their investment property. You can then use this dashboard tab to compare that agaist the average house value to compare costs vs capital growth.


4. Neighbourhood Analysis
* This tab shows average house values filtered by neighbourhoods, this is helpful for an investor to firstly understand where they could potentially buy an investment property based on their budget. The snapshot shows an overal price range and then also growth per neighbourhood. This is useful for gaining an overal snapshot understanding of the real estate market and growth for suburbs which may then assist narrowing down to a set of neighbourhoods that perfom well and are in the price range. The dwelling unit types section in this tab can then assist in understanding the types of dwellings in the neighbourhood which could help assess which neighbourhoods are more densly populated or are more larger family homes. This is useful for identifying potential neighbourhoods that are most likely to contain the type of property you are looking for. You are able to drop down and select from the list particular neighbourhoods you want to get data for. 


5. Top Expensive Neighbourhoods
* This tab shows the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods in the Toronto area. The chart then shows the average house value and how this has increased over the years. This is useful for determining the capital growth at the top end of the Toronto real estate market. You are able to hover over data or select slices of the cost analysis chart to zoom in on particular years.
